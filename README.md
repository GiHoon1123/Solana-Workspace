# Solana Workspace

This repository collects personal study materials, experiments, and reference projects while learning the Solana blockchain ecosystem.

## Layout

- `prc/` – Anchor framework practice projects (added as a submodule from [solana-anchor-examples](https://github.com/orakle-7th-sda/solana-anchor-examples)).
- (More folders will be added as additional experiments are created.)

## Getting Started

```bash
# clone the workspace
git clone --recursive https://github.com/GiHoon1123/Solana-Workspace.git

# initialize/update submodules if you cloned without --recursive
cd Solana-Workspace
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Happy building on Solana!
